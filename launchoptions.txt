add these to your launch options

-threads 4 -noborder -no_texture_stream -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -sillygibs +violence_ablood 0 +violence_agibs 0 +violence_hblood 0 +violence_hgibs 0

replace the number after "-threads" with the amount of your cpu threads

"-noborder" makes the game run in a borderless window if you choose "run in a window", 
so you can use borderless fullscreen, borderless fullscreen adds input lag because the
windows DWM has vsync enabled permanently, so i recommend not using it

"-no_texture_stream" disables texture streaming so textures won't appear blurry for the first seconds

"-novid" disables the valve logo at start saving time

"-nojoy" and "-nosteamcontroller" disables gamepad and steam controller support reducing resource usage

"-particles 1" limits beam count to the minimum of 512

"-precachefontchars" precaches font rendering for common characters

"-sillygibs +violence_ablood 0 +violence_agibs 0 +violence_hblood 0 +violence_hgibs 0"
i use these options mainly because the blood particles and the gibs are pretty distracting to me, 
sillygibs replaces gibs with well, silly parts like gears that dont look as distracting and the other
options disable blood spraying and particles that really distracts me, 
these options are also useful if you dont like the amount of blood tf2 has.
